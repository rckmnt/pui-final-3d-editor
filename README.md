PUI Final - A 3D Product Web Editor
========

This project explores how WebGL and Three.js can be used to make a 3D product editor.


# Splyt UI

This is the start to a parametric WebGL UI for creating Splyt Lights. Splyt lights have only a few pieces and can be built upon by screwing Splyts together.
